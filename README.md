## Introduction

My name is Aarav Prakash, I have been flying quadcopters for around 3 years now. I have noticed that quadcopter technology continues to improve and is becoming more and more powerful. Due to this power, I thought it might be a good idea to get into the hobby.

## Project Overview

How can drones be used to modernize and aid the police force? The current world record for the fastest quadcopter speed was set at 235 miles per hour by the XLR V3, which was made from off the shelf parts. The XLR V3 also has a camera on it, allowing for computer vision models to be run. With this technology readily available, it could help the police force improve by large amounts for a cheap cost. We found that the color, make, and model of a car in an automated car detection system would be useful to the police force. In our approach, we created two Convolutional Neural Networks. One detected the make and model of a car, the other detected the color.
